# SirSwin
The SirSwim is a cheap video game home console that i'm building for my self but the code will be on github to make your own and is powered via raspberry pi 5 8GB ram
# More info
The device will come out a os known as SlowOS with SirShop build in to install apps and every game can be download since i designed SirShop to run
on low end devices like the raspberry pi 5, SlowOS is themed after a the hit famous pokemon Slowpoke (pls dont sue)
# The SirShop 
Whlie making i think 16MB LIMIT was too well stirct so i think 32MB was a better option but also i want to really get as much from the raspberry pi 5
